# Analysis and Forecasting with ARIMA

This repository contains a project focused on **time series analysis and forecasting** using **ARIMA** models. The project demonstrates how to implement ARIMA modeling using Python libraries like `pmdarima` and `statsmodels` for energy market analysis.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to forecast future values in a time series using ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. ARIMA models are powerful tools for analyzing time series data, making predictions based on past observations.

Key tasks involved:
- Time series data loading and preprocessing
- Building ARIMA models with `statsmodels`
- Using `pmdarima` for automatic model selection
- Forecasting future values based on the trained ARIMA model

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pandas==1.5.3
numpy==1.21.6
matplotlib==3.5.3
seaborn==0.11.2
scikit-learn==1.0.2
openpyxl==3.0.9
jupyter==1.0.0
notebook==6.4.12
statsmodels==0.13.2
pmdarima==1.8.5
```

To install these dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/energy-markets-analysis.git
cd energy-markets-analysis
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis_and_forecasting.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis and forecasting results.

3. Modify the dataset and model parameters as needed to apply ARIMA models to different data or tasks.

## Key Features

- **Automatic ARIMA Selection**: Using `pmdarima.auto_arima`, the model automatically selects the optimal ARIMA parameters (`p`, `d`, `q`) based on the time series data.
- **Modeling and Forecasting**: The project walks through building, fitting, and forecasting using the ARIMA model with `statsmodels`.
- **Visualization**: Forecasted values are visualized with `matplotlib` for easy interpretation.
